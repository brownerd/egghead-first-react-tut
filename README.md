# Egghead React App Tut

I am attemptig to tackle this the [Build Your First React.js App](https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application) from Egghead after recently completing the [REACT FOR BEGINNERS](https://reactforbeginners.com/) by Wes Bos.

## Notes

I know that everything has changed, thus the egghead tut can't use the latest React Router, Babel or whatever else. But I figured I'd give it a go anyway.


I'm totally new to Webpack. I followed [Using ES6 and ES7 in the Browser, with Babel 6 and Webpack](http://jamesknelson.com/using-es6-in-the-browser-with-babel-6-and-webpack/) to get Webpack set up.

I've been using [REACT FOR BEGINNERS](https://reactforbeginners.com/) to figure out the routing.

## Stuck

I can't seem to get past the routing part of this. I can load the entry route fine, but when I switch to another route I get a `Cannot GET /` error.
